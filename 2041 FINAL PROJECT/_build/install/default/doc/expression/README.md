How is the work divided for this first partial submission?
(An ideal answer would be: we try to do everything together. Having one person do the parser and another the lexer is a bad idea since the two are intertwined. Likewise, the group should agree on datatypes for the abstract syntax tree before splitting off the printer.)

We are both going to be working on the same thing together to make sure we understand everything that is going on
